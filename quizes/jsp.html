<ol>
    <li> <span> What is the main value of Java Server Pages? </span>
		JSP files helps us embed java logic with the raw html, so we can add more dynamsim to the html pages and logic.

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> How are JSP pages related to servlets? </span>
        <div>
             the JSP server compiles the class generated by the JSP engine to a servlet.
	     example the tag <%= hello %>
	     is converted to
	     out.print("hello");
        </div>

    </li> <br>


    <li> <span> How are JSP pages related to HTML? </span>
        <div>
            JSP pages are a combination of the HTML code and the Java code. JSP runs on the server whereas HTML runs
            on the browser.
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .  </span>
        <div>
		<% count ++; %>
		in actual code
		count++
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. </span>
        <div>
             <%! int count = 0; %>
	     java code
	     int count  = 0;
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet. </span>
        <div>
            <%-- jsp comments --%><br>
	    java code
	    // jsp comments `
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.  </span>
        <div>
            <%= hello %><br>
	    out.printl("hello");
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet </span>
        <div>
            <%@import ArrayList  %><br>
	    import ArrayList;
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Explain how an EL expression is evaluated. </span>
        <div>
		EL has the same state mangments in servlets but also has page scope aswell.
		the difference is it does not throw an exception if not found other like servlets, it ignores the statment.
        </div>

    </li><br>


    <li> <span> Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions </span>
        <div>
            EL uses by default PageContext which scans in subsequently the page, request, session and
            application scopes for the firstnext non-null attribute value matching the given attribute name
            We can explicitly specify the different scopes as ${pageScode}, ${requestScope}, ${sessionScope} or
            ${applicationScope}.
        </div>

    </li><br>



    <li> <span> Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact. </span>
        <div>
            A RequestDispatcher object can forward a client's request to a resource or include the resource itself in the
            response back to the client. A resource can be another servlet, or an HTML file, or a JSP file, etc. The other
            servlet or JSP is called as if an HTTP request was sent to it by a browser.
        </div>
